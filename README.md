Key Terms and Concepts
Express: minimalist web framework for Nodejs
Middleware: function that has access to request/response and modify or end the request
Routing:Routes map HTTP methods + URL paths to handler functions.
Weâ€™ll use express.Router() to keep routes modular.
CRUD: Create, Read, Update and Delete
fs module: Node builtin fs for "file operations"

UUID: What is this?
File Structure

curl: It is a simple command-line tool for making HTTP requests. It sends HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to a URL and prints the response.
eg: curl http://localhost:3000/health //sends GET rewuest to the endpoint and shows JSON response

app.get(path,handler)
eg:
app.get("/", (\_req: Request, res: Response) => {
res.json({ status: "OK" });
});
registers a route for HTTP GET request on the given path.
Handler function: It receives two parameters, \_req(the incoming request) and res(the response helper)
res.json(..) sends back a JSON response with 200 status code.

app.listen(port, function): starts the HTTP server, callback runs once the server is up
eg:
app.listen(PORT, () => {
console.log(`ðŸš€ Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});

\_req vs req

app.use(express.json())
Middleware in Express is a function that runs on every request (or a subset of routes) before your route handlers.
express.json() is built-in middleware that parses incoming JSON in the request body and populates req.body with the resulting object. Without it, req.body is undefined when you send JSON, so you canâ€™t read title, content, etc.

curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/notes \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"title":"My Test","content":"Hello, Node!"}'
